# Etch A Sketch

Etch a Sketch a vanilla JS project that mimics the basic functionality of a drawing board. Originally started as a basic 'hover-over' painting tool, the project has since grown to a 'paint-like' tool. The project has been ofcourse only built for learning purposes, the optimised approach to drawing on a webpage would use canvas as opposed to divs used in this project. Nonetheless, a fun project to explore around.
